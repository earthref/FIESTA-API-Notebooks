This GitHub repo contains Jupyter Notebooks with examples of using [EarthRef.org's FIESTA API](https://api.earthref.org).

[EarthRef.org](https://earthref.org) is a geoscience umbrella website for several data repositories. These repositories, unified under the mandate to preserve their respective data and promote scientific collaboration in their fields, are also disparate in their schemata. The Framework for Integrated Earth Science and Technology Applications (FIESTA) project is creating the tools to easily customize and manage these geoscience repositories and the [FIESTA API](https://api.earthref.org) is a core component of that solution.
